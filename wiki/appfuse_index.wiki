#summary Starting a Django project
= Introduction =

This project goal is to create a minimun project that works but that goes beyond the Django tutorial.
That is, it will give you an scheleton that will allow you to create cruds operation, use of i18n, etc.

This is the first phase, playing a bit with Google subversion and defining the project. At this stage
it shows:

 * A basic project structure.
 * How to make a project developer independent, using a separated file to store the configuration.
 * Configuration to serve static media throught the Django server
 * Some simple views to show and edit a record
 * Use of pagination

== Installation ==

 * Install the last Django svn.
 * Install sqlite libraries
 * Checkout the project
 * Copy properties.py.template to properties.py and cofigure it accornding your needs
 * run the server : python manage.py run server
 * point to http://localhost:8000/agenda

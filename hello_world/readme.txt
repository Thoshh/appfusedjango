I have read a PHP framework comparision http://www.kumbiaphp.com/blog/2009/03/27/benchmark_frameworks_kumbiaphp_vs_symfony_zend_cakephp/ and I decide to write my own for comparision

Best performance Kumpiaphp: 34.07 req/s

Best performance for Django using CherryPy: 334 req/s

not too bad, isn't it?
